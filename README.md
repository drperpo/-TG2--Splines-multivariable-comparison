# STRATOS TG2- Splines project multivariable comparison


## Contents
 - Rscripts: Code that was used to create the ISCB2022 Splines presentation. File `mvrs.R` is very crude and may contain errors. `ISCB2022-analysis.Rmd` should have all the background code that was used to create the presentation. 
 - Data: has all data files used. 
 - Docs: Powerpoing presentation and a word file with initial thoughts on the project
 
 
 ## Next steps: 
 
 - Agree on the datasets that may be used to work on the project. Suggestion: https://zenodo.org/record/7554815#.Y_OxYnbP3iA and Marc  Henrion suggested TB data. 
 - Agree on comparison metrics for the approaches 
 - Agree on overall structure and protocol
 - Agree on people that may have time and interest to work on the project
